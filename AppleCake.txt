Tips from the Betty Crocker Kitchens
tip 1. A fancy phrase that means serving with a generous scoop of ice cream. Even fancier? Whip up some heavy cream, flavored with a splash of caramel coffee syrup and a dash of cinnamon.
tip 2. The best baking apples are slightly tart, hold their shape during the cooking process and aren’t too juicy. Top choices are Granny Smith, Braeburn, Cortland, Northern Spy and Rome Beauty.
tip 3. Spread a smear of peanut or almond butter on a slice of this moist cake for an on-the-go breakfast.
tip 4. This cake is also delicious cooled and dusted with powdered sugar.
tip 5. For more apple bite, chop the apples into small chunks rather than shredding them.
